## Time tracking

### Scenario 1 - Emilio needs to fill out a timesheet for a work week

Assumptions:

- Emilio is doing contractual work - a single client contracted at a specified rate with a start and end date, with an agreed upon timesheet structure e.g., Client A weekly timesheet billed at rate A, Client B fortnightly timesheet billed at rate B
  - Data Entities: Client, Contract --> Time length, time structure, pay structure, pay rate
- Weekly time period - Monday start and Sunday end: Assumes UK western based work week. For other continents, work week is different, e.g., Dubai (UAE) is Sunday start - Sat end.
- Time worked per day - Full day, 3/4 day, 1/2 day, 1/4 day vs hours logged
  - For this scenario, all that matters is billable hours
- Rates applied

  - This could be based on a prepopulated custom rate selected by the user vs a free text field
  - scenarios where an end user works for more than one client at a time, on a given day, there could be different hours associated to one client, on one particular rate, vs a different rate for another client
  - will a timesheet be created on a per-client basis, or should the client be a filterable option per time worked within a timesheet (thus allowing multiple clients)
  - For other scenarios,

Data:

- Contract/Job

  - What is the job?: Context, Description
  - Who is the job for?: Client -- Name, Address, Contact Person VAT Number (if applicable), Agency -- Name, Address, Contact Person, VAT Number (if applicable)
  - When does the job begin?:
  - How long is the job for?: In days, weeks, months from start date (Job Term)
  - Working Hours (Normal working hours) AM - PM equivalent of working day: e.g., 8 hours = 1 Day
  - Working Days (work week): Mon - Sun
  - How much you charge for the job
    - Time based rate: rate per hour or rate per day or flat fee
    - If flat fee - work out what the day rate is,
    - If day rate - work out what the total is

  ### Scenario 2 - Emilio has freelance work

  - Timesheet needs to allow entry of adhoc work - a single client contracted at a specific rate for a piece of work
